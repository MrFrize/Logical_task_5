It depends on the factors:
What typr of jungles i am in?
Does it have trees suitable to build boat/raft?
Do i have some equipment?
What is the depth of the river?
What is the width of the river?
1 Approach:
I can simply jump over if the river width allows me to do it.
2 Approach:
I can ford the river in case depth of the river lower then my height
and i can be sure there is no dangerous creatures under water.
3 Approach:
I can build a boat or a raft. To do this, i need trees from which i 
can make a base and oars, as well as creepers for ropes.
